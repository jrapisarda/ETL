    def extract_expression_matrix_streaming(self, tsv_path, study_code):
        """Yield melted expression data chunks"""
        # Uses PyArrow for memory-efficient streaming
        # Computes content hash for idempotency
        # Validates data consistency
```

**Key Features:**

        # 1. Check for study-specific overrides
        # 2. Apply regex rules in priority order
        # 3. Return classification with confidence
```

**Inference Rules:**
1. Septic shock indicators → SEPTIC_SHOCK

```python
class PlatformNormalizationEngine:
    """Standardize platform names and extract metadata"""
    
    def normalize_platform(self, platform_raw, study_technology):
        """Extract accession, name, manufacturer, technology"""
        # Handles "Name (Accession)" format
        # Manufacturer lookup table
        # Technology inference from study metadata
```

#### 2.1.4 Enhanced Data Loading
```python
class EnhancedDataLoader:
    """Load data with MERGE operations and performance optimization"""
    
    def load_all_data(self, transformed_data):
        """Upsert dimensions, bulk load facts"""
        # Uses SqlBulkCopy for staging
        # MERGE statements for dimension upserts
        # Content-hash based duplicate prevention
```
